# Section 5: Formatting and Annotations

## How to Annotate Screenshots

**NOTE:** Annotations done in SnagIt.

Screen shot formatting rules:

- Crop out the menus (when possible), so that the image is easier to maintain.
- Annotations
  - Color: Primary Blue \- \#0078E5; rgb(0, 120, 229\)
  - Alt Color: Zynga Brand Red \- \#DC0606; rgb(220, 6, 6\)
  - Font: Helvetica Nue | 16pt | 400 weight |
  - Numbering Style: ![Annotation indicator](/img/contributors/annotation-indicator.png) (point toward the item)  
     **NOTE**: It is not necessary to use numbering on screenshots, but if you choose to do so, use it consistently.
- Sizing (to ensure consistent proportions): width between 1000 and 1200 pixels
- Highlighter: yellow 75% opacity
- Arrows: 3pt
- Boxes: 3pt, rectangular with rounded corners
- Callouts: 3pt, rectangular with rounded corners
- Blur: Information that is not sensitive (blurred info can be decoded), intensity \= 2-4
- Remove sensitive data: keys, PID, etc
- Borders:
  - All sides
  - Color=black
  - 1pt
  - No shadows
