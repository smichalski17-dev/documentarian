# Capitalization Rules

Capitalize:

- Product Names
- Company Names
- Field Names
- Occasionally for EMPHASIS

Use Title Case for: (Title Case Capitalizes All Words Except Prepositions and Articles \- First and Last Word Are Capitalized Regardless)

- All Headings in the Docs
- Image Labels
- Bullet Lists of Key Components (For bullet lists of activities or descriptions or other longer descriptions use sentence case.)

DO NOT capitalize words that are commonly used product names; only capitalize names if they are trademarked or unique to Zynga or another company.

# Punctuation Rules

## Periods

Use periods only after complete sentences. Do not use periods after phrases, for example, in the case of lists.

| ❌ Periods are NOT used here                                                                                                                                                          | ✅ Periods are used HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Commas

The general rule of the thumb with commas is, _when in doubt, leave it out_. The following rules, however, are immutable.

- **Series (Oxford) comma**: When a comma comes before the conjunction in a list of items

  **_Example_**: _The people on my team write code, keep track of emerging use cases, interface with new users, and remediate bugs._

- **Before a conjunction separating 2 independent clauses**: When two complete sentences (independent clauses) are separated by a conjunction creating a single sentence, a comma comes before the conjunction.

  **_Example_**: _The documentation portal assists current users by providing practical tutorials, and its complete product catalog is designed to attract additional users by showcasing the complete range of ZMGT’s products and services._

- **After an introductory dependent clause followed by an independent clause.** (The dependent clause always starts with an “ing” verb or a subordinating conjunction)

  **_Example_**: _After the game is first launched, the player must accept the terms of service (ToS)._

- **After an adverb or adverbial phrase when they come at the beginning of a sentence.**

  **_Example:_** _Optionally, you may change the package name, BundleID, used, but this is not necessary._

- **Around an appositive phrase, a descriptive word or phrase that comes before it.**

  **_Example:_** _Optionally, you may change the package name, BundleID, used, but this is not necessary._

- **Around non-essential descriptors or interruptors.**

  **_Example_**: _Android Playstore’s fees, which we are trying to avoid by using zConnect, have increased every year for the last five years, taking more and more of the profits from game makers._

- **Within dates and addresses**

  **_Examples:_**

  - _May 15, 2025_
  - _15 Clearview Drive, Phelps, New York USA_

- Commas not much used in technical writing:
  - **Direct address**: Fritz, please calm down.
  - **Dialog**: On the seventh day, the developer looked up from his code and proclaimed, “It is good; it is very good.” And it was.

## Colons

Colons are used to:

- Set off lists either when they are bulleted or numbered
- Set off a list within a sentence or paragraph
- Separate a term from its definition or description in technical writing

| ✅ Colons are used HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ✅ and HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Semi-Colons

Semi colons are used in only 2 cases:

- **To replace a comma between a conjunction separating clauses**: When two complete sentences (clauses) are separated by a conjunction creating a single sentence, a semicolon may replace the comma that comes before the conjunction. This is usually done when the topic is closely related.

  **_Example_**: _Only users with Admin permissions are able to run the GET userlist API call; the userlist returns PII that must be kept secure._

- **To replace the first level of commas in a complex series**: When the sentence contains a series and one or more of those series also contains a series

  **_Example_**: _Three teams contributed to the project: the Core team built out the APIs, setup the database, and wrote the Kubernetes jobs; the UI team developed the forms, wrote the wizard, and created the messaging tool; and the QA team ran the API calls, wrote automated tests for the UI, and documented the test plan._

- **When too many commas complicate a sentence**. The requirement of the commas in the game company names plus the series commas would make this sentence confusing, so we replace the series commas with semi-colons.

  **_Example_:** _Games published under these accounts have the Apple publishing configuration baked in, and no additional steps must be taken for: Zynga, Inc.; Zynga Mobile; Zynga Game Network, Inc.; Town’s End Studio, LLC; and Rollic Games._

## Dashes

There are 2 kinds of dashes that are used for specific purposes in technical writing.

**En Dashes do not require spaces on either side**

- **Ranges**: Used to indicate a range between numbers, dates, or periods.

  **_Example:_** _"The reaction time was between 1–3 seconds."_

- **Compound Modifiers:** Join compound modifiers, especially when they are already hyphenated or consist of two-word nouns.

  **_Example:_** _"The condensed matter–biology interface is complex."_

- **Between Dates/Years:** Used to separate dates or years within a range.

  **_Example:_** _"The project spanned from 2020–2022."_

**Em Dashes require spaces on either side**

- **Parenthetical Information:** Used to set off parenthetical information within a sentence, similar to parentheses but with more emphasis.

  **_Example:_** _"The device — designed for portability — is easy to use."_

- **Marking a Break:** Can be used to mark a break in a sentence, often to indicate a sudden change in thought or tone.

  **_Example:_** _"The results were surprising — we didn't expect such a high failure rate."_

- **Emphasis:** Can be used to highlight information that is being emphasized.

  **_Example:_** _"The key to success — consistent effort — is often overlooked."_
