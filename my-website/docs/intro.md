## Templates

In this section you will find the templates I developed to assist developers and project managers who were tasked with writing documentation. They could either start with the templates in Google docs or they could use them from markdown. 

In addition these templates were used by the LLM agent and applied to documents that required reorganization in the migration stage of the docs portal build project.

Examples have been scrubbed since the content was proprietary. Apologies for anything that seems nonsensical.
