# About Susan Michalski

![Author picture](\img\tech-writer-1.JPG){width=2955px height=1278}

Susan Michalski grew up in rural upstate New York with three brothers, two sisters and an assortment of strays. After getting a degree in English and Drama from SUNY Geneseo, she hit the road, making her way to California via Cedar City, Utah where she sewed costumes at the Utah Shakespearean Festival and then Berkeley Repertory Theatre.

She returned to Syracuse to perform on stage at the Salt City Center for the Performing Arts, to coach swimming, and to get her teaching certification from Lemoyne College. 

Then it was off to Florida to teach English and drama at Martin County High School where her brilliant students inspired her to pursue her writing dreams by attending graduate school. Susan received a Master's fellowship and degree at the University of Louisiana, Lafayette in Literature and Creative Writing under author-in-residence, Ernest Gaines. 

Masters degree and a couple of literary publications in hand, she spent the next phase of her life writing and teaching at Austin Community College in Texas and Montgomery County Community College near Philadelphia. 

Life happened: marriage, divorce, loss, and birth (of the most amazing person). Susan poured herself into motherhood, animals, violin, art, friendships, a career, and, as always, writing.

When duties of motherhood grew less consuming, Sage, Finn, Ethan, and Elena were born and The Geodesy Series took shape and became a reality - books in libraries that people really seemed to like.

Now there are more stories and books percolating and coming to fruition in a cottage in central Austin, Texas where Susan writes AI documentation by day and everything else after the witching hour.
